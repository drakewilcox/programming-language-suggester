## Description

_This webpage is an exercise in using jQuery. The goal of the project was to create an application that would tell users which programming language they should choose to learn first based on answers to a set of questions. In the questions, each choice was given a numeric value through jQuery, and then those numeric values were added through functions in javascript. This app then displays 3 various answers based on conditions of the added numerical values established through branching._
